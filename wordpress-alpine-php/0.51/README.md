## How to turn on Xdebug
1. By default Xdebug is turned off as turning it on impacts performance.
2. Connect by SSH.
3. Go to ```/etc/php7/conf.d```,  Update ```xdebug.ini``` as wish, don't modify the path of below line.
```zend_extension=/usr/lib/php7/modules/xdebug.so```
4. Save ```xdebug.ini```, Restart apache by below cmd:
```/usr/sbin/httpd -k restart```
5. Xdebug is turned on.

## Updating WordPress version , themes , files

If ```WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE``` = false  ( which is the default setting ) , we recommend you DO NOT update the WordPress core version , themes or files from WordPress admin dashboard.

Choose either one option to updated your files :

There is a tradeoff between file server stability and file persistence . Since we are using local storage for better stability for the web app , you will not get file persistence.  In this case , we recommend to follow these steps to update WordPress Core  or a theme or a Plugins version :
1.	Fork the repo https://github.com/azureappserviceoss/wordpress-azure
2.	Clone your repo locally and make sure to use ONLY linux-appservice branch
3.	Download the latest version of WordPress , plugin or theme being used locally
4.	Commit the latest version bits into local folder of your cloned repo
5.	Push your changes to the your forked repo
6.	Login to Azure portal and select your web app
7.	Click on Application Settings -> App Settings and change GIT_REPO to use your repository from step #1. If you have changed the branch name , you can continue to use linux-apservice . If you wish to use a different branch , update GIT_BRANCH setting as well. 

## Connect WordPress to Redis

3. In the left navigation, select **Plugins**, and then select **Installed Plugins**.

5. Click the **Enable Object Cache** button.

## Limitations
- Some unexpected issues may happen after you scale out your site to multiple instances, if you deploy a WordPress site on Azure with this docker image and use the MariaDB built in this docker image as the database.
- The phpMyAdmin built in this docker image is available only when you use the MariaDB built in this docker image as the database.
- Please Include  App Setting ```WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE``` = true  when use built in MariaDB since we need files to be persisted.
